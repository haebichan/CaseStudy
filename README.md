# Sale Price Prediction using various Regression techniques


## The goal
Predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuration. The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.

## Evaluation

Evaluation of my model will be based on Root Mean Squared Log Error.


## Data

The data for this case study are in ./data. Although there are both training and testing data sets, the testing data set will only be utilized to evaluate my final model performance. In other words, I used cross-validation on the training data set to identify potential models, then those models will be scored on the test data.
